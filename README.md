# Features
* Players are able to play Battleship by inviting one another via the ~play @opponent command.
* The bot will display the game boards to each of the players via two private text channels between the bot and the two players, so that the main server will not be filled with bot messages.
* The bot uses the discord reaction system to identify moves made by players and determines their validity, and once a valid move is discovered, player boards are edited instead of sending new messages as to not overwhelm the users.
* Player boards are randomly generated.
